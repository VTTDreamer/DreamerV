<p>Hi, how do you do? My name is Victor Tang Tzechung. I was born and raised in Malaysia and am currently living in the
   province of Subang Jaya, in the state of Selangor.</p>

<p>I am living with my family still eventhough I am already 21. I have my parents and two siblings, my older brother and
   my younger sister. I am currently unemployed and I came from two different colleges before. One of them is the INTI
   Laureatte College and the other is the critically acclaimed and fabled college, 'The One Academy'.</p>

<p>My goals in life is to become a writer, living and taking care of my mother while still being able to support her and
   myself to the very best of my abilities. I hope that one day I would be able to find that special someone out there for 
   me; to love each other to the fullest and to be there for each other through pain and joy.</p>
